If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever overheard a biologist muttering curses at a petri dish, chances are their cloning has gone wrong.
Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? Let&amp;rsquo;s take a peek at the r/labrats subreddit, where desperate researchers bare their souls:
“For cloning, the most reliable method is a contract with a demon, higher the better.</description></item><item><title>Leaf color change in 10,950 iNaturalist observations</title><link>https://etowahadams.github.io/post/2020-01-09-maple-red-leaf/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2020 21:19:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://etowahadams.github.io/post/2020-01-09-maple-red-leaf/</guid><description>Process overview. Skip to process explanation One of the unexpected consequences of attending college in Connecticut has been experiencing autumn twice a year. I watch the trees of New Haven1 change color during late October and early November, then return home in Georgia for fall break and watch the leaves change color again.
I understood the basic principle behind my double-dipping of fall. In late October, Connecticut is colder and receives less daylight hours than my home in Georgia, triggering trees stop making green chlorophyll and allowing the yellows, oranges, and reds of the other pigments (like xanthophylls, carotenoids, and anthocyanins) to become visible earlier.</description></item></channel></rss>
