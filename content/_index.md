Hello! I'm Etowah Adams. {{< figure src="array.png" caption="No, this isn't a Pollock painting. It's a DNA sequencing flow cell in action.">}} 

I'm interested in problems at the intersection of biology and computing. 

Currently, I work as a research software engineer in the [HIDIVE lab](https://hidivelab.org/) at Harvard Medical School.
