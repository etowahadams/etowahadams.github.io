Hello! I'm Etowah Adams. {{< figure src="array.png" caption="DNA sequencing microarray. Gleaning biological information through chemistry, light microscopy and image processing.">}} 

I'm interested in problems at the intersection of biology and computing. Well, if it makes sense to draw a distinction between the study of "biology" and "computing" in the first place. Seeking not inter-disciplinary, but rather [ante-disciplinary](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010006) science. 

Currently, I'm working on developing technologies for genome-scale engineering of microbes.
