Hello! I'm Etowah, a second year PhD student in Systems Biology at Columbia studying machine learning and biology. I am advised by Prof. [Mohammed AlQuraishi](https://www.aqlab.io/). In my research I seek to build increasingly complete (re: multi-modal, temporal, molecular) representations of biology to understand and engineer biology.

In my undergrad at Yale, I developed CRISPR-based gene editing tools with Prof. [Farren Isaacs](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OCyNKlYAAAAJ&hl=en). Subsequently, I worked at Harvard Medical School as a research software engineer with Prof. [Nils Gehlenborg](https://hidivelab.org/team/members/nils-gehlenborg/) on [tools](http://gosling-lang.org/) for genomics data. I also developed software at [Ginkgo Bioworks](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/) as an intern. I'm originally from southern Applachia where I grew up on a small farm. 

I am happy to chat about research or anything else! Feel free to reach out. A few things I love discussing: self-supervised learning, mechanistic interpretability, protein structure prediction, amortized sampling, cloud labs, optimal experimental design, expansion microscopy, CryoET, WebGL, and banjo.
