Hello! I'm Etowah. I'm a PhD student in Systems Biology at Columbia. {{< figure src="array.png" caption="No, this isn't a Pollock painting. It's a DNA sequencing flow cell in action.">}} 

I'm interested in building increasingly complete (re: multi-modal, temporal, molecular) representations of biology to understand and engineer biology. I hope to do so by advancing techniques in machine learning, biophysics, experimental optimization, and patience. 

I cut my teeth doing gene editing and evolutionary genetics research at Yale (where I studied molecular biology and computer science). Subsequently, I was a research software engineer at Harvard Medical School in the [HIDIVE lab](https://hidivelab.org/) working on open source tools for genomics ([Gosling](http://gosling-lang.org/)). I also developed software at [Ginkgo Bioworks](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/) as an intern. 

I'm originally from southern Applachia where I grew up on a small farm.
